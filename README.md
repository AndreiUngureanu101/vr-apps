# VR Apps

A selective list of the VR Apps that I've created using the [Oculus Rift headset](https://www.oculus.com/rift), the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine and the [Leap Motion controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/). Source code or builds are provided depending on the application. Please refer to the specific readme file for each project folder.

## Contents

* Static Gesture Recognition: Unity project that lets you define and incorporate any static (frame time duration) gesture in your own application.

* Gestures Blackboard: Application that helps you learn twenty-four Romanian sign language static gestures.

* Rock-Paper-Scissors: Application that challenges the player to a rock-paper-scissors duel against the computer.

* Shelf Test & VR Studio: A market research oriented application that helps brands test different shelf product placements. General purchase data (products bought, gave up products, ...) is recorded and with the help of VR Studio software specific data is generated (heatmaps, AOI - Areas of Interests, FI - First Occurance: .)
