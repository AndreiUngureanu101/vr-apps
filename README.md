# VR Apps

A selective list of the VR Apps that I've created using the [Oculus Rift headset](https://www.oculus.com/rift), the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine and the [Leap Motion controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/). Source code or builds are provided depending on the application. Please refer to the specific readme file for each project.
