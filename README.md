# VR Apps

A selective portofolio of VR Apps that I've created using the [Oculus Rift headset](https://www.oculus.com/rift), the [Leap Motion controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. Source code and builds are provided depending on the application. Please refer to the specific readme file for each project folder.

## Contents

* ```Gestures Blackboard```: This VR Application recognizes  24 Romanian sign-language static gestures, each one corresponding to  a letter of the alphabet.

* ```Rock Paper Scissors```: This VR Application challenges the player to a rock-paper-scissors duel against the character Pepe, the universal champion at this game!

* ```Shelf Test & VR Eye Studio```: Shelf Test is a market research oriented VR application that helps brands test different shelf planograms. Five shelves with different product placement strategies are created and a respondent chooses the desired products from each shelf according to a predefined scenario (ex: buying snacks and beverages for her/his guests). General purchase data, like products bought and returned to shelf is recorded and specific data is generated with the help of VR Eye Studio software, like heatmaps for eye gaze and AOIs (Areas Of Interest) metrics for areas of the shelf defined by the user.

* ```Static Gestures Recognition Unity project```: This Unity project lets the user define and utilize her/his own static gestures in a VR application. A static gesture is defined as having a frame time duration, so the system will be able to detect an executed gesture for every frame.
